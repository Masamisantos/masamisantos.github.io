<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<p>My name is MASAMI SANTOS.</p>
<p>I'm a WEB / GRAPHIC designer based in San Francisco, CA, designing user-friendly interfaces with simplicity and beauty in mind for clients in the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<br>
<p>I was born and raise in Japan and came to the U.S. in 2002 to study graphic design.
Throughout college, I have gained great time managment skills that allow me to work on multiple projects at once. </p>
<br>
<p>I am a hard working individual with a great attention to detail. I enjoy new and challenging projects that push me to learn more in the great field of web and graphic design. </p>
<br>
<p>On the digital side, using HTML and CSS, I can create anything from a small mobile site to a desktop site. I build sites that do not just look good on your desktop, but are also fully responsive so it looks and works great on all tablet devices and phones too.</p>
<br>
<p>I also create branding logo and any print needs you may have. From business cards and stationery through to brochures and signs. With years of experience in print design, I can give your brand a refresh look for your company brochure.</p>
<br>
<p>Whatever your needs and goals do, get in touch and I can advise how I can help you take this forward. If you would like to discuss your project then do get in touch and drop me a message.
